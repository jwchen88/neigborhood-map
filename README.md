# Lakewood Neighborhood Map Project

This is the final project for Udacity's GWG FEND Nanodegree course. Neighborhood Map project is a single page application featuring a map of Lakewood neighborhood in Dallas, TX. The map shows restaurants in the neighborhood, and it gets restaurants' address information through Four Square.

## How to Run the Project

## Service Worker

The service worker only works when npm build is ran in production mode.

* start the server with `serve -s build`
If server isn't installed run `npm install -g serve` before `serve -s build`
